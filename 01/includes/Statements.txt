I was overwhelmed by the complexity of this assignment at first. I began to read
the textbook up to chapter 7, did some googling, and more research with AI.
Then I doubled back and read the textbook some more to make sure that my code
only used what is taught from chapter 1 up to chapter 7. I did additional testing
and am confident I now have completed all assignment specifications.
