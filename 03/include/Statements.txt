In this program, I learned how to separate class declarations and implementations 
into .h and .cpp files. I also practiced using vectors, handling exceptions with try/catch, 
and creating static data members. Working with time functions and passing a string by reference 
helped me reinforce concepts from Chapters 7, 8, and 9.
