I began by reading the textbook up to Chapter 13, doing some Googling, and conducting further research
with AI. Working with Program 07 helped me understand how overloaded stream operators provide a natural interface for C++ classes.
 I found implementing the extraction operator (>>) particularly challenging because it required careful validation of the phone number format. 
 The most difficult part was properly handling the stream state and ensuring that invalid inputs were rejected while still allowing the program to continue running.
  I gained valuable experience with string handling in C++, especially with the character array manipulation needed to extract the area code, exchange,
   and line number components from the input.
