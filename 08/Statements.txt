Working on Program 08 gave me valuable experience with file handling in C++. 
The most challenging aspect was correctly parsing input files using different 
delimiters and ensuring proper validation of user input. I learned how to 
effectively use vectors to store and process data from multiple files 
simultaneously. The implementation of search functions based on different
 criteria (like CustomerID or ZipCode) helped me understand the importance 
 of data relationships across multiple files. Managing stream states and 
 providing informative feedback to users was another essential skill I
  developed through this project.
