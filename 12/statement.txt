In this program, I implemented a custom Stack class template utilizing a vector for storage and provided function templates 
for common stack operations. I ensured that the program interacts with the user by offering a menu-driven interface and incorporated exception handling to
 manage errors during pop and top operations on an empty stack. This assignment helped reinforce my understanding of class templates, function templates, 
 and exception handling concepts covered up to Chapter 18.
